### Breaking Changes

* `diff` command can no longer be used to display a test report. Use `show` instead.

### Improvements

[1.10.0] (2020-03-04)
---------------------

### New Features

* Add `account` sub commands which allow users to login/logout and display the local API key
* Change `diff` command: compare any two golden masters. The option `--output` offers the possibility to save 
the differences as test report in the specified directory, and the option `--exclude` to filter the differences.
This command may still be used to show results of a test report. But it is advised to use the new command `show` instead.

### Improvements

* Do not print stack trace when a report is in an incompatible version.
* Exit with a non-zero return code when a sub-command encounters a problem.
