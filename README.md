## Download and Installation

You can download the most recent version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/retest/recheck.cli/releases/). Afterwards, you have to include the CLI into your path to use it from your shell. On Unix-like systems, you can do this by adding the following snippet to your `.bash_profile` and/or `.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="${PATH}:/path/to/recheck.cli/bin/"
```

On Windows, you can add `/path/to/recheck.cli/bin/` to your path by following [this tutorial](https://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

## Enabling Shell Auto-Completion

You can obtain an auto-completion script for Bash and ZSH via the `completion` command.
Simply add the resulting output to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, for example:

```
$ echo "source <(recheck completion)" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
